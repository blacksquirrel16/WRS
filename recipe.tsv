(i think next time i will try a vegan version by also replacing the buttermilk with soymilk.)  every time it has turned out perfect!

this is a dense, moist layer cake. i cut each layer in half so i get 4 layers and slather them with ""perfect chocolate frosting"" (recipe #86768). the end result is a fudgy chocolate layer cake with tons of frosting (and yes, it is going to be sweet). it is key to cut the layers in half. it ends up being a much moister cake this way because the frosting kind of melts into the cake layers forming a kind of fudgy filling in between the thin cake layers. i hope you enjoy it :)"	"[""devil's food cake mix"", 'instant chocolate pudding mix', 'sour cream', 'water', 'vegetable oil', 'eggs', 'chocolate frosting']"	7

so many people have asked me how long to cook tenderloins if they have ""more than one"" to cook, i wanted to give a simple response.  answer:  so long as the tenderloins are not touching each other, cook 3 or 4 individual tenderloins for the same amount of time as if you were cooking one.  remember, each tenderloin is cooking in its own separate space.  example:  if cooking three 1-pound tenderloins, cook them only 5-1/5 minutes total.   this makes it a great entree recipe when having a dinner party for 8-12 people, or more.

tips for chips: i notice one reviewer had difficulty with the chips. here are a few tips or tricks for chips: make sure they are dried thoroughly. make sure the fat is very hot - 190 degrees c. certain potatoes are better for chipping, such as king edwards, desiree, majestic, maris piper, and romano. you can soak the chips for an hour before the first frying - it extracts excess starch, which helps in the ""crisping"" process! always drain them thoroughly before serving. i hope these tips will help!"

update: since i first made this five years ago, we still enjoy this at least once a month. i have found that i can alternate the ingredients to use up items i have in the fridge. i have used mushrooms, sauteed onions, cherry tomatoes and even feta cheese instead of cheddar cheese. and it always comes out fantastic. i have also found that there are times i need to use more or less eggs depending on the ingredients. also, a glass pie pan is so much better than a metal as it toasts the tortilla just right. such an easy recipe with gourmet taste!"

important:  take your roast out of the fridge, and let it set to get it to room temperature before baking!

if you like really rare bake for 15 mins. at 500.  

if you like your roast beef cooked med-rare, put in for 18 mins. at 500.

if you like it well done, then just burn the darn thing lol.

what's nice about this roast is, if someone likes it done a little more, please keep in mind that the end pieces will be done a little more.


***(the roast in the series of photos that i took was a 2.75 lb. bottom of the round roast.  i baked it at 500 for 15 mins., then turned the oven off and left it in the oven for 1 hour for a rare roast.) 

the cooking time is 5 minutes per pound but i couldn't reflect that in the cooking time in the time section for the recipe, at the bottom so i just put in  15-30 mins, depending on size of the roast you use (3-6 lb)"	['roast beef', 'onion', 'garlic powder']	3

using a large pan, place a large plate or vegetable steamer in the bottom of your pan after you add the water.  stack the corn vertically with the stems down on the plate/steamer.  you should be able to put about 12 ears in to steam doing it this way, if your pan is big enough."

i have found that you need to follow the directions *exactly* to get the best cookies. not using real butter or all brown sugar, not beating the eggs in one at a time, not baking them at a higher temp than the ""traditional"" recipe, all make a difference in the end result. 

i have also found that land o' lake butter makes a better cookie than some generic brand butter. don't let the butter sit out too long. it needs to soften but if it sits until the moisture starts to separate from the butter, it is too soft and it will affect the resulting cookies. if that happens, refrigerate the dough for about an hour to help them not spread as much. it also helps to use the mixer on the dough in between batches going into the oven. it helps keep the dough from starting to separate if it is a warm day. 

another thing i've learned is you have to make sure there is plenty of circulation in your oven. when i moved, my cookies started turning out flat again. i finally realized that my oven was smaller at the new house and when i switched to smaller cookie sheets, my cookies turned out perfectly!"
